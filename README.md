# Laser-Security-System-
It is a device that emits light based on the stimulated emission of  electromagnetic radiation. The system works when the laser emits a narrow beam of light and  detects an intruder by sensing the reflected light wave from the intruder themselves.

## Introduction
With development of new technology, new methods of security are being explored in order 
to protect valuables in the setting of any space such as home offices, banks etc. One such 
methods utilizes a laser system, and this method has proven to be very effective in increasing 
security. It is used in many applications from advanced home security systems to lockers in 
banks. “LASER” is an abbreviation that stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated 
Emission of Radiation. It is a device that emits light based on the stimulated emission of 
electromagnetic radiation. The system works when the laser emits a narrow beam of light and 
detects an intruder by sensing the reflected light wave from the intruder themselves. A laser 
diode and module are used to detect the presence of an intruder. When an intruder is detected, 
an alarm system is activated and a buzzer goes on, thereby alerting the human security in the 
space. Furthermore, as an additional step to the security system, a green-light and red-light 
LED is used to indicate the presence of an intruder. The green light is on when the laser diode 
and module can detect the emitted light rays. When the detection loop is broken, it indicates 
the presence of an intruder and the LED turns to red light while also ringing the buzzer at the 
same time. This project builds the entire laser security system using all the hardware 
components to detect intruders in a high security location.
