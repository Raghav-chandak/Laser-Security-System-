# Laser-Security-System-
It is a device that emits light based on the stimulated emission of  electromagnetic radiation. The system works when the laser emits a narrow beam of light and  detects an intruder by sensing the reflected light wave from the intruder themselves.

## Introduction
With development of new technology, new methods of security are being explored in order 
to protect valuables in the setting of any space such as home offices, banks etc. One such 
methods utilizes a laser system, and this method has proven to be very effective in increasing 
security. It is used in many applications from advanced home security systems to lockers in 
banks. “LASER” is an abbreviation that stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated 
Emission of Radiation. It is a device that emits light based on the stimulated emission of 
electromagnetic radiation. The system works when the laser emits a narrow beam of light and 
detects an intruder by sensing the reflected light wave from the intruder themselves. A laser 
diode and module are used to detect the presence of an intruder. When an intruder is detected, 
an alarm system is activated and a buzzer goes on, thereby alerting the human security in the 
space. Furthermore, as an additional step to the security system, a green-light and red-light 
LED is used to indicate the presence of an intruder. The green light is on when the laser diode 
and module can detect the emitted light rays. When the detection loop is broken, it indicates 
the presence of an intruder and the LED turns to red light while also ringing the buzzer at the 
same time. This project builds the entire laser security system using all the hardware 
components to detect intruders in a high security location. Arduino Uno R3

## Connections
The major components of the project involve Laser diode, LDR module, LEDs (red or 
green), buzzer, and Arduino Uno R3. With the help of a breadboard, all these components 
are connected. The LDR Sensor Module involves three pins: the Vcc, ground and output 
pin. The Vcc and ground are connected to the breadboard and the output pin is connected 
to pin 7 of the Arduino Uno R3 board. Similarly, the laser diode consists of positive and 
negative terminal. The positive terminal is connected to the Vcc of the breadboard and 
the negative terminal is connected to the ground of the breadboard. 
Furthermore, there are two LEDs that are used in the project. Each LED represents the 
working condition of the system: the red LED indicates presence of an intruder whereas 
the green LED is the normal state of the system. The positive terminal of the red LED is 
connected to the negative terminal of the resistor. The positive terminal of the resistor is 
connected to the fourth pin of the Arduino Uno R3 board. The negative of the red LED is 
grounded. Similarly, the positive terminal of the green LED is connected to the negative 
terminal of the resistor. The positive terminal of the resistor is connected to the eleventh 
pin of the Arduino Uno R3 board. The negative of the green LED is grounded. 
There is also a buzzer connected in order to alert the user in case of intruder presence. 
The positive terminal of the buzzer is connected to the positive terminal of the resistor 
and the negative terminal is grounded. Overall, the components above connected in this 
particular manner provide the successful functioning of the system.

## Conclusion 
Overall, the laser system successfully detects objects in its range with the help of a laser 
module and diode and also alerts the owner with an LED system as well as a buzzer system. 
Since the light waves travel through fog, smoke, etc., it makes it ideal for security applications 
in defence systems as well. Furthermore, the system is very cheap to make and also integrates 
very easily with other bigger application systems. All these features allow the system to be 
used in a wide range of applications. However, the system does pose its own disadvantages 
that need to be developed upon. For example, the laser security system only works when an 
intruder breaks the laser light. Now since the laser light is very narrow, if the intruder is 
skilled enough to pass the area without disturbing the laser, the system can be considered as 
a failure. Furthermore, this system covers a very small area of protection. In order for there 
to be high level security or security over a large area, a number of lasers and other components 
need to be used, which can amp up the total cost of the system, while still holding the same 
disadvantages. Therefore, this system needs to be modified in order for it to be a more reliable 
system of security. All in all, this project summarises the uses, applications, working, 
advantages and disadvantages of a laser security system.
